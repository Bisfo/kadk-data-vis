Taught by [Annelie Berner](http://www.annelieberner.com/) at the [The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts](https://kadk.dk/en/programme/visuelt-design)

March 10 - April 3rd, 2020  

## Online Plan
As we cannot be in the same location for the next 2 weeks, we will follow this plan for how to continue the learning:

1. Communication: I will send important updates on the #general channel on slack. You can always also reach me at a.berner@ciid.dk or +45 50 21 27 65

2. "Location": We will meet on google hangouts from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (excluding lunch and coffee, water breaks) on each class day. 
To join the video meeting, click this link: https://meet.google.com/wfw-ofqr-irx
Otherwise, to join by phone, dial +45 70 71 41 20 and enter this PIN: 195 549 041#
To view more phone numbers, click this link: https://tel.meet/wfw-ofqr-irx?hl=en-419&hs=5

3. Lectures: Join me on our google hangout at 9 a.m. during our course days (check below for the course day list)

4. In-class exercises: Stay on google hangouts. Use slack to post about programming questions in the #code channel. Ping me directly about any personal questions as you work. 

NOTE: As we will all be on video calls for many hours, feel free to simply mute yourself so that the sound coming from all our devices do not make too much audio chaos :) I prefer that you keep your video cameras ON as much as possible because this also helps me to see whether you are physically available (I can ask you a question or ask for your input) or whether you may have gone to another room for water, etc. 

5. Homework: Remains the same. I will review your work once you post it in the #assignments channel.
6. Guidance: Remains the same: sign up for "office hours" with me or ping me at any time during our course days for extra help, project mentorship, brainstorms, troubleshooting. 
7. Peer-to-peer learning: We will stay on google hangouts when working on in-class exercises. Therefore, feel free to simply un-mute yourself and ask someone a question just as you would in the class at any point. Also, PLEASE post any questions, code issues, thoughts in slack. 
8. Materials: 
    a. Lectures: After each lecture-day, I will post a PDF of my slides on slack. 
    b. Code: I will also continue to post all relevant code on github. Make sure you can pull my updates to your local repository. Tutorial [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository) 
    c. Handouts: When there are handouts for you to read, I will upload them in a handouts folder or share links to them in slack. 
    d. References: The [reference page](https://github.com/aberner6/kadk-data-vis/blob/master/references.md) is constantly being updated with new inspiration, talks, readings, code tutorials, etc. Please check it on a daily basis. 
    e. Syllabus + Assignments: I will keep the [syllabus and assignments page](https://github.com/aberner6/kadk-data-vis/) - both contained here on our main website - up to date with class structures as well as due dates (as they evolve). Please check it before each class.

## Description:
Visualization is an increasingly important part of making sense of our highly networked, data-rich world. Using a combination of interpretive methods and representational techniques, we will explore various ways visualization can make invisible relationships, structures and stories visible. We will learn how to extend the capabilities of ordinary perception to tell stories and draw insight from information. 

We will use analog and digital techniques to practice creating compelling interactive data visualizations using a variety of data. We will learn how to collect, classify, encode, and display data and use interactivity to construct relationships and meaning. The course will involve drawing, prototyping, and programming using data.

Along the way, we will also learn about the principles and processes of data visualisation, how to develop small projects, tell stories with data, the ethics of working with data, use web programming technologies to express ourselves. 

We will focus our data visualisations on the topics of cycles, seasonality, repetition, and time in relation to the environment, changing climate, and ecosystem. We will use data about the past, present and future of our environment. 

Part A will be a warm-up and introduction to the topics of design, data, programming, getting set up and familiar with our topic. Part B will focus on playing and experimenting with data visualisation. Part C and D will focus on mini-project development, finessing and communication. 

## Main Topics:  
* Interactive data visualisation
* Programming, troubleshooting
* Programming for the web
* D3.js
* Data visualisation processes
* Storytelling
* Visual encoding
* Data and Ethics
* Seasonality, patterns, time
* Climate, environment, ecosystem

## Our Expectations:  
* Each week's plan and the accompanying assignments will shift slightly to accommodate the pace of the learners.
* Attendance is mandatory. Please inform me via email if you are going to miss a class.
* This class is participatory. You are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students both in class and participate with their projects.

* You will gain resources to dive deeper in the future
* It takes years to get familiar with code so expect to hit your head against your computer for many hours.
* Expect to ask for and give help.
* Breaks are good. Take as many water, stretching and bathroom breaks as you need

## Documentation & Communication:  
* Turn your assignments in before each morning class as indicated on each assignment deadline.
* Keep your blog/slack post to assignments and github up to date with the work you did in-class and/or in the assignments.
* Join our class [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/kadk-data-vis/shared_invite/zt-cgw2xpjl-rdazZK9PXAZmEBm_qW1Ugg) to easily chat and help one another with small things.
* In the afternoons, I will be sitting at KADK but not always in the same room as you - depending on what we are all working on. You can always book me for office hours [here](https://kadk-data-vis.youcanbook.me/).

## Student Work
* We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you should be prepared to show/talk about them in class. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments. Feel free to use your preferred platform for the blog - for example, tumblr. You can also make your own "blog-like" spot - for example, google slides, docs, etc. - as long as it is online.

# Schedule
Every day, we will go through some variation of: 
* inspiration - review - code - design - theory - exercises - wrap-up
We will timebox, which means that we will get to wherever we get to within each topic/day and some may roll over into the next or some may be achieved more quickly in which case we will move forward

## Part A
* Warm up to the class, topic and technique

### March 10 (Day 1)
* Focus: Warm up
* Lecture: 
    - Overview: introductions (to [me](https://www.one-tab.com/page/nY8VhXY0RG6tMer25MqiGw) and you), class structure 
    - Theory: processes
    - Design: why visualise + inspiration 
    - Code: the web, our coding environment, html/css/js
* Exercises: 
    - Analog data collection, analysis, visualisation
* Assignment: due before Thursday at 9 a.m.
    - Admin: set up blog or if you prefer, you can simply plan to post on our slack channel "#assignments". Post your code on your [github account](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop) + sign in to our [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/kadk-data-vis/shared_invite/zt-cgw2xpjl-rdazZK9PXAZmEBm_qW1Ugg)
    - Design: post your work from the analog data exercise
    - Theory: find one data visualisation inspiration for you (could be digital, art, a piece of nature like tree rings) - feel free to use the [references page](https://github.com/aberner6/kadk-data-vis/blob/master/references.md) where there are many inspirations - and post the link or a photo with a discussion of: 
        - Why it inspires you
        - Who it is for
        - How you think they built it
        - What its goal seems to be
    - Read: [The Philosophy of Data](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/brooks-the-philosophy-of-data.html?_r=1&)
    - Extra: Watch [Amanda Cox](https://vimeo.com/29391942)
